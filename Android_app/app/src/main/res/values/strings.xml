        Gaze is an hybrid game : a mix between a video game and a board game.
        The goal is to find anamorphic shapes on a physical board.
        Once you find a shape you validate it by taking a picture, <b>the game will recognize if it is the right shape</b>.\n
        \nGaze was designed to be a multiplayer game, but if you are alone you can still play.
        Application will propose you 3 shapes : an easy, a medium and a hard. You will have to chose one of them.
        The more difficult a shape is announced, the more difficult it is to be found, but it will give you more points.\n
        \nNow it&quot;s up to you : <b>find it on the board, and validate it by taking a picture.</b>\n
        \nThe <b>first player who find 4 shapes make the game stop</b>, and the <b>player who have the most of points win</b> !
